# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Welcome to the **Cloud API** of Bosch eBike Systems. We provide several APIs. Just explore the different categories and pick and integrate those APIs into your application, which are necessary for your use cases.

- **Flow/Cloud API** provides riders read-only access to their data like eBike profile and activity records, collected via the eBike Flow app.
- **BCM/Cloud API** empowers partners to manage Bosch ConnectModule (BCM) configurations and to subscribe to BCM events in order to receive notifications.
- **Data/Cloud API** enables partners to upload bike model information like bike specifications and bike images to be served by the eBike Flow app when users are connecting to a specific bike.

## API maturity types
There are several maturity types of APIs, listet in the Cloud API reference documentation.
### Draft APIs
Draft APIs are early versions of APIs, which are not stable and cannot be used for production purposes. The API version is the date of the last change. Draft APIs are using the prefix `Draft` in the API name. The intention of publishing draft APIs is to involve you already in an early stage during design and development of new APIs. So please don't hesitate to send us your feedback.
### Beta APIs

### Production APIs
There are stable APIs, which can be used for your production purposes. The API version follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Production APIs don't use a prefix in the API name.
